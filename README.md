---------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea comes from :
    http://www.yapcna.org/yn2009/talk/2018
and
    http://www.slideshare.net/miyagawa/building-a-desktop-app-with-httpengine-sqlite-and-jquery

The database example comes from:
    http://blogs.perl.org/users/joel_berger/2012/10/a-simple-mojoliciousdbi-example.html

A Mojolicious::Lite method for creating single file applications that use a browser for the UI.

The concept is to start a Mojo server and launch a browser to connect to it.
